## Welcome to Soren Gran's Github!

**I am a Data Analyst in the Washington, DC area.**

### My Favorite Projects/Articles
- As an Intern for the Office of Data Governance and Analysis at Legal Services Corporation, I had the opportunity to contribute significantly to an open-source Python package called [cleancourt](https://bitbucket.org/lsc_odga/cleancourt/src/main/).
- I applied Topic Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation to patent data to explore technological trends from country to country. Check it out [here](https://github.com/stgran/lda_topic_modeling). I also wrote an article about this project on Medium, which you can read [here](https://soren-gran.medium.com).
- As part of a four-part series on applying Convolutional Neural Networks to Kaggle's [Cactus Identification Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification), I wrote about Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Read it [here](https://soren-gran.medium.com/part-4-model-interpretation-with-lime-and-concluding-remarks-fdcfa6dae667).

### My Interests
I am fascinated by the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am excited to explore how machine learning and statistics can catapult forward our ability to analyze text data rapidly and at scale.  
I enjoy soccer and chess (play me on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/NurseDrunkenstein) or [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/sorenfukboi)).
